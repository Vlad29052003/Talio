## Description of project
Talio is a web application designed to help users manage projects and tasks. Talio allows users to organize
tasks into boards, lists, and cards, making it easy to track progress. With Talio, users can easily
create new boards, and track progress or set the level of priority using customizable tags. Whether you're working on a personal project
or managing a team, Talio provides a powerful and intuitive way to organize your tasks and stay productive.
Additionally, Talio offers support for collaborative work, allowing more users to view and edit a board at the same time. This way, we make it easier
to track and manage group projects and help everyone be on track with his/her tasks.

## How to run it

The application consists of two different parts: a REST API which serves as the server and manages the connection with the database and
the client application which is built using JavaFX. In order to run the application,several steps are required to be performed.

#### Downloading the application
1. Download the project repository and save it in the desired directory. The project can be found [here](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2022-2023/teams/oopp-team-48.git).
2. Open a terminal (for example cmd on Windows). This can be achieved by pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>. In the menu that opens, type
cmd` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This will open the Command Prompt.
3. Type `cd` followed by the absolute path in the command prompt. For example, `cd C:\Users\Username\Documents\oopp-group-48`. Then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. Run the following command `gradlew build`. This will build the project and install the needed dependencies. If the job succeeds, as it should, it will look something like this:

#### Running the server
1. After completing the downloading phase and making sure that the project has been built, the server can be run.
2. In the same terminal, type the following command: `gradlew bootRun`. This will wun the server. It should look like the following, if everything has
been done correctly so far:
<img src="./resources/BootRun.jpg" height="400">
3. Now the server is running. It is running by default on `http://localhost:8080/`.

#### Running the client application
1. Leave the terminal in which the server is running open.
2. Follow the same procedure as before: open a new terminal and navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
3. After reaching the directory, while having the server running (the application can be run without the server, but it will not have many features as most of them involve
communication with the server) run the following command: `gradlew run`.
4. Now, the client application has been opened, and the application can be used.
