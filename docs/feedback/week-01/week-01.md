#### 1) Self-organization: Good!
		I was surprised how well everybody contributed to the discussion, although it was our first meeting and I was expecting you to be quite shy at first, you were open and everyone raised important points throughout the discussion. Everyone had a friendly tone, good job!
		For the future meetings, the only advice I would give for now is to try to engage more with the people that seem to be quiet, and to leave them some space so they can also talk comfortably.

#### 2) Suggested Topics: Good!

		For this week, you are still getting accustomed to how the meetings will be handled, so far everything was alright. However, starting next week, I expect that the chairman will lead the discussion, and that the points in the agenda will be discussed. Remember to go back to the Teamwork lecture if you still have doubts. My last piece of advice would be that you share the agenda a few days before the meeting, or at least a day before it, so the others will know what the meeting will be about and in what order, otherwise some teammates might have no clue at first of a certain topic.
