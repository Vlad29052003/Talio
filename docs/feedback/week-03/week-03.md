#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Andrei Petre
Minute taker: Jesse Klijnsma

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting was lead by a (new) chair, and the team also had a (new) minute taker, great! 

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good! 

Feedback: The agenda was sent on mattermost before the meeting, which is good, and it was quite clear what each point described. However, I felt that the agenda was quite dilluted and it could have used more talking points. For instance, "approval of the agenda" was set to last 15 minutes. I think more could have been done in these 15 minutes. The template wasn't strictly followed, you have the template in docs. Please remember to also add your agenda under docs/agendas!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: None.

Feedback: Performance of *previous* minute taker has been delivered already. I will give feedback to the 2nd minute taker in the feedback after 3rd week's meeting.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The chair lead the discussion, and covered the agenda with the topics in order. Every topic was given enough time, but as a consequence of the dilluted agenda, the topics at one point changed frequently and the meeting became a bit chaotic, and thus harder to lead and keep on track. I would recommend giving a bit more attention to the agenda.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: I have only great things to say in this section, the team took the lead and the discussion was held in friendly and constructive atmosphere. Moreover, everyone contributed by either asking questions, answering them, or just by making observations. Everyone was engaged, actively listening, which is why I would say the meeting was quite productive.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You did not present the current state of your application. This should start happening already next week, so I can start to observe some progress.
