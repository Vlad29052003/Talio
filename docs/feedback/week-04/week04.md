# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Vlad Graure
Minute taker: Lovro MlikotiÄ‡

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team had a new chairman and a new notetaker, hooray!

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The agenda was sent on mattermost well ahead of the meeting, and it also included recent relevant developments (the publishing of the official backlog), which I found quite important. However, this is a reminder to please add all the agendas also on GitLab! The agenda followed the template, and a clear structure, that was easy to follow, especially with the bullet points for each section.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The notes were well structured and clear, and included the most important topics discussed. The notes were easy to follow, and the agreements made are actionable, realistic, and I also liked that you set deadlines for task assignments. That helps with organising and with keeping everyone on the same page. What I could say you could improve on, is to also include certain things you as a team ask me, and that I answer, so you will remember my feedback even after a few days. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The meeting was really well organised, because the chair lead the discussion according to the agenda. The topics was properly covered, discussed and the goals set in the agenda were accomplished. All the topics were covered in an appropriate amount of time. I also appreciated that the chair came really well prepared to the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting, and the discussion was held with a friendly, easy-going tone. Some of you had valuable input and it really showed me that you were actively listening to the ones speaking. However, I noticed that two of you, who were active before, weren't that involved in the discussion, please try to be more engaged, in every meeting, by answering to certain questions and by looking at eachother when speaking.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The team presented the current state of their application, with the improvements they made over the past week. All the changes shown were merged into main. The progress is quite good, compared to last week (keeping in mind that you only started last week), and I liked that you experimented with both some front-end features, and also some back-end. The team looks on the right track to create a working application until the end of the project!
