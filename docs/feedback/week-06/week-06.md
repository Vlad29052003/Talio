# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Lovro Mlikotic
Minute taker: Andrei Petre

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team had a new chair and a new note-taker, hooray!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The agenda was sent ahead of time on Mattermost. Please remember to also post it on GitLab! The agenda followed the template and had really clear points. I liked that you had bullet points for certain topics. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: The notes have been posted to GitLab appended to meetings.md, under docs. The amount of notes taken was good, and the level of detail was very high. The notes were clear and easy to read. The notes contained the concrete agreements and the tasks assigned to people. The agreements were both actionable and realistic. I appreciated that the notes are divided in sections, and are summarised correspondingly under each bullet point.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The chair ensured that all the topics were covered. What I felt, even though I think each topic was covered in an appropiate amount of time, I believe the meeting felt a bit rushed or you just had not enough topics to discuss. In that case I suggest having some extra stuff at the end (question for me for instance), so you make the most out of the meeting :D.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good!

Feedback: I want to start with the negative feedback first, if you're not speaking during the meetings (at least 2 of you), please be more involved!!!! Now moving on to the positive feedback, the team took complete ownership over the meeting and (mostly) everyone was involved in the meeting and the discussion. The overall atmosphere was constructive, and suggestions were made using constructive criticism. Everyone was listened to.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The team presented me with the current state of their application. It is potentially shippable, and the team showed a lot of progress compared to two weeks ago, by having a fully working application where you can actually create boards. I believe some nice css could make everything a lot prettier ;). If the people that are doing below average work will step up, you are totally on the right track to create a working application until the end of the project.
