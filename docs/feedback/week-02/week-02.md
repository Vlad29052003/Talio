# Week 2

- **Chair**:  Olaf Herman
- **Notetaker**: Jochem Pouwels

#### Meeting Organization

Feedback: Pass! The meeting was well organised, with the agenda being sent before the meeting. The team also had a minute taker. Everybody arrived on time and the meeting followed the agenda, without being chaotic. Great job!

#### Agenda 

Feedback: Good! The agenda was well-documented and it had all the information required. The agenda was also presented well ahead of the meeting. You could use the template in the future to make the document "weigh" more. 

#### Chair performance

Feedback: Excellent! The chair went through each point in the agenda thoroughly, without overlooking anything. The chair also left enough room for the others to contribute, without dominating the discussion. Well done!

#### Time management

Feedback: Good! I believe enough time has been spent on any topic. However, I would like to add that we could have spend a lot of time on the Code of Conduct. In general, I would say it is better to work on certain assignments together outside meetings.

#### Minute taker performance

Feedback: Good! I believe the amount of notes are enough! One thing I believe you could improve on, is to check the notes before sending them to correct any spelling mistakes, or sentences that do not end properly (e.g. there was a line that stated "- needs to be in the ", without any conclusion).

#### Relation

Feedback: Good! I believe the chair managed the discussion really well, and listened and engaged with everyone. I think the atmosphere was very friendly, butou got "good", instead of excellent, because there are some people that I would love to listen more to ;), so that everyone would contribute equally.
