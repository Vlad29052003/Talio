### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: A single pdf document has been uploaded under the docs folder.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The document has the correct structure: the listed stakeholders, a useful terminology section and a prioritised list of user stories. The document provides the right level of detail in each of these sections. The language used does not contain typos and is quite easy to follow.


### Epics

Mark: Good!

Feedback: The backlog contains an epic for basic requirements, and one for advanced requirements. While the epics themselves are quite clear, you could have made use of mockups to clarify certain features. Instead of grouping advanced requirements in a single epic, maybe think about how you could split this in multiple epics, which contain features related to a certain topic. I believe you could also fit your other epic in the newly formed ones ;).

### User Stories

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: The backlog contains user stories that correctly follow the required format and the user perspective is very clear. There does not exist an obvious overlap between requirements and the epics are covered with a nice amount of user stories. The requirements do not contradict eachother.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The size of most user stories is small and each user story is meant to describe only one responsibility. For most requirements the acceptance criteria is measurable from the user story itself. You could add acceptance criteria where it is not implicit how a requirement would be fulfilled.
